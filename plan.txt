    Loading T's image to create arrays and stuff and unstub the scene
T:
X   Main/game application/state machine
X   Draw images
X   Input/player controls
    Renderer stub

Day Two:

Day Three:



























PUZZLE GAME JAM

levels

pieces - gather X amount of pieces
 |
placing pieces in the right positions

problems
 |
finding solutions
 |
mental challenge

resources:
    - usually given X which you have to utilise to solve the problems

goals:
     - can be whatever you want
     - to get somewhere
     - collect pieces
     - often results in "order"

ideas:
    evacuation game:
        - building with exits
        - flock of people within the building
        - danger within the building, maybe always a fire that spreads
        - flock runs away from danger, panic spreads
        - resources (e.g. emergency signs) to be placed to create a "flow" out of the exits

examples:
    portal:
        - "FPS"
        - physics: ballistics, portals, lazerzz
        - utilise physical objects
        - avoid harm/danger
        - goal is to get somewhere

    supaplex:
        - platformish tile thing
        - grid-based
        - utilise "tile pieces"
        - avoid dangerous tiles
        - goal is to collect pieces (and reach a spot)

    jigsaw puzzles:
        - god mode
        - figure out which piece is next to another and where they fit based on a picture
        - goal is to put together the pieces

    minesweeper:
        - click based, third person
        - grid-based
        - logic/deduction
        - avoid clicking on tiles with mines
        - as fast as possible
        - goal is to work out where all mines are

    lemmings:
        - assign X antal roller to lemmings
        - goal is to get all the lemmings to the exit

    the incredible machine:
        - place elements at their right positions mechanically
        - goal is to solve mechanical problems

    world of goo:
        - place goo blobs in the right spots "structurally", based on their different properties
        - build a bridge to a destination

    bejeweled:
        - gems in 3-in-a-row at least
        - goal is to get as high of a score as possible
